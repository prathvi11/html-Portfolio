<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Prithviraj Singh, also known as Danny to my friends and colleagues. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in 
  Computer Applications (MCA) and am in my second semester. My passion for technology and problem-solving drives me 
  to explore the ever-evolving world of Information Technology, with a strong focus on backend development and 
  artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>
  I specialize in Python programming and have built a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
  I enjoy the challenge of solving complex coding problems, and platforms like LeetCode are my go-to for sharpening my
  skills. Alongside Python, I’m also learning JavaScript for front-end development.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to my academic pursuits, I’m passionate about AI and Machine Learning, aiming to contribute meaningfully
  to these cutting-edge fields. I love breaking down complex algorithms and developing solutions that not only work but
  are efficient. My journey doesn’t stop here—I’m also looking to expand my knowledge of technologies like React and
  Django as I prepare for upcoming campus placements and future opportunities.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding or solving DSA problems, you’ll find me building my portfolio and engaging with the tech community
  to stay updated with the latest trends. I live in Jabalpur, India, and am always open to new opportunities—whether it's
  for internships, projects, or even a simple chat about technology and innovation!
</p>

<p>
  If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to share a good laugh (I love a clever pickup line), feel free to explore
  my portfolio or get in touch.

  Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
